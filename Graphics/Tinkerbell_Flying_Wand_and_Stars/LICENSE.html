<h4>LICENSES</h4>
<p>HelloSVG comes with a free (implied) commercial license FOR PHYSICAL PRODUCTS with every download up to 500 items.&nbsp; In other words, if you're selling less than 500 items with one of my designs, you can use it free of charge to make and sell products.&nbsp; However, this is not a license to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may NOT sell digital products</li>
<li>You may NOT modify my design and resell as a digital product</li>
<li>You may NOT sell commercially over 500 items with an single design</li>
</ul>
<p>If you sell more than 500 items, contact me so we can discuss a reasonable fee.</p>
